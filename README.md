# CSS-drawing
My attempts at using CSS as a drawing tool.

1 - A moustache made by transforming a single div to this moustache icon by using two box shadows and 2 psuedo elements (before, after) and  drawed the curve parts by using border-bottom.

2 - A clock made from pure css with added functionality to represent the current time. I used JavaScript to get the current time and used a setInterval function to increment the angle of the hour, minute, and second hands.
